Autocomplete
============

This rep contains an n-gram language model that predicts the next word, given a phrase of text as input. The prediction model is implemented as a shiny web application, in which the input text box was enabled with the functionality of the jQuery-ui autocomplete widget. The end result is a list of suggested words that shows up underneath the input text box and gets continuously updated as the user types.
